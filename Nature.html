        <h3><a href="Flora.html"><strong> Flora</strong></a></h3>
        <p><strong>"Flora"</strong> refers to the plant life that is found in a particular region, environment, or time period. It encompasses all types of plants, including trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses. The term can be used broadly to describe plant life in general or specifically to denote the collective plants of a certain area, such as "The Flora of The Amazon Rainforest."Flora is often studied in fields like botany, ecology, and conservation.</p>

        <h3><a href="Fauna.html"><strong> Fauna</strong></a></h3>
        <p><strong>"Fauna" </strong> refers to the animal life found in a particular region, environment, or time period. Similar to "flora," it encompasses all types of animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects. Fauna can be studied at various levels, such as the fauna of a specific habitat (like a forest or desert) or the fauna of an entire continent. Understanding fauna is important for ecology, conservation, and biodiversity studies.</p>

        <h3><a href="Ecosystem.html"><strong> Ecosystem</strong></a></h3>
        <p><strong>"Ecosystem" </strong> refers to a community of living organisms like plants, animals, and microorganisms that<br>interact with one another and their physical surroundings. It includes both biotic (living) and abiotic<br> (non-living) elements, such as water, soil, air, and climate. Ecosystems can range in size from a small<br>pond to a large forest or even the entire planet. The relationships within an ecosystem, including food<br>chains nutrient cycles, and energy flow, contribute to maintaining balance and supporting life.
